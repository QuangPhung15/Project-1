intro = """Now we're going to play TOTALITY:
Players will choose a number of rounds to play.

Player 1 will roll 3 dice.
They are trying to get the highest total possible on the three dice,
but dice with the same value MUST be multiplied together!
Example: 332 --> 3 * 3 + 2 --> score of 11

After rolling 3 dice, Player 1 has the option to end their turn
or re-roll 1 of the dice in an attempt to get a higher score.

Player 2 then gets a turn to do the same thing.
After player 2 has finished, the final scores are compared to determine the winner.
The player with a higher score receives 1 point for the round.

Points are totaled after the final round and the winner will be declared.
.............................................................................
Now let's start the game \n"""
